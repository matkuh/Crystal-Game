### I used HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, and JQuery to build an adding and guessing game.  You get 4 buttons, each assigned a random number between 1-12.  When you click a button, it adds to your total, which you have to make equal to another randomized value.  Wins and losses are also tallied.  

## Tech I Used 

1. [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
2. [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) 
3. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
4. [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)
5. [JQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp)
